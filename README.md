# PixelArtMiniProject
Andela Learning Community, front end web development final project.

This is a simple project where the user is able to specify the dimensions of a design grid that they want to work on. The grid is dynamically generated and the user is then given the option of selecting the color they would like to use in creating their pixel drawings ad designs.
